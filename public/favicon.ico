The favicon.ico file is a binary file that typically contains the icon image data. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon.ico file separately and place it in the specified directory.

Please ensure you have a valid favicon.ico file ready to use in your project at the path: /my-nextjs-blog/my-nextjs-blog/public/favicon.ico.
